# Learn-C

## Hello World
The following prints 'hello, world':
```
#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
  printf("hello, world\n");
}
```
Note than printf is a function from standard library, not part of the C language.

## Declaring Variables
```
int lower;
lower = 0;
float step;
step = 10.0;
```
Other data types: char, short, long, double. \n
Also: arrays, structures, unions of basic types, pointers, functions.

## While Loops
```
while (i < j)
  i = 2 * i;
```

## Operations
Division truncates for integers. \n
c will be zero, since 5 and 9 are integers. \n
d will not be zero since 5.0 and 9.0 are floating point numbers.
```
c = 5/9
d = 5.0/9.0
```
